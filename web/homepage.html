      			<h3>About</h3>
      			<p>My name is Matt Beagley. I am a senior studying Software Engineering. I've been married to wife Rachel for a little over 6 years. I'm orginally from Seattle, but I currently live in Cedar Hills, Utah.</p>
      			<p>I enjoy playing videos games, as well as table top games like Dungeons and Dragons. Some of my favorite video games are Overwatch, Pokemon, and Legend of Zelda. I also really enjoy comedy. I've been writing and preforming stand-up comedy for a few years now.</p>
